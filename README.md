# TrafficLight-Detector
Simple traffic light detector by opencv python
***
TrafficLight-Detector(TLD) is a script to detect traffic lights, red? green? or yellow ones.  
TLD performs well in the daylight with only about 100 lines code. See results [here](light).  
Ideas from two opencv demos: [hough circle transform](http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_houghcircles/py_houghcircles.html#hough-circles) and [object tracking](http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_colorspaces/py_colorspaces.html).  
If the detection results is not satisfied, you can adjust some params to get a better result.

## How to use
1. Make sure the resolution of your sample images being not too high (1024*768 is prefered).
2. Pull them into /light folder.
3. Run the script main.py
4. You will get the results in /result folder.
